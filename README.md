# LinearHPScaling

This plugin rescales the Shield and Hull HP of most ships in the game, using the T1 human ships as a basis, and trying to scale HP linearly across Tiers.

The basic idea is that a T2 HW would now have around 2x the HP of a T1 HW. This is not always followed perfectly, as this plugin also aimed at trying to keep important match-ups roughly equal to vanilla HP values (for instance, Wanderers vs the Automata, Mereti vs Sestor, Heliarch vs Quarg), but regardless higher Tier ships have their HP cut significantly.

With the difference in HP reduced, earlier ships, such as human ones, have more of a chance against higher Tier ships, meaning their usefulness is extended into later in the game should one still want to play with human ships at later points.

Spacefaring creatures such as the Void Sprite and Subsidurial were not affected. The Archon has also not been altered yet, but may be included in later releases, depending on if and how the Drak are rebalanced now following the Quarg Revamp.

Below are some before and after comparisons of HP
