This plugin changes the Shields and Hull of many non-human ships, seeking to make the scaling of HP throughout ES's Tiers less steep. The new values were made by taking the HP of human ships (such as the Navy warships) as a basis for Tier 1, then multiplying by 2 for Tier 2, and by 3 for Tier 3, as well as for the intermediate Tiers, and then tweaking the values a bit while still trying to keep to around the same new margin values.
